In this description of the neuron model, there is a continuum of memory regions from unconscious to significant, outputting values from 0 to 1 in response to an input signal. A value closer to 1 gives access to a region closer to significance, while a value closer to 0 gives access to a region closer to unconsciousness. The closer the output value is to significance, the more information is transferred to short-term memory, resulting in a process that is recognized as a statue or subconscious memory. This model represents a hierarchy of conscious and unconscious information processing.
